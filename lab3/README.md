CS360: Systems Programming

-----------
Description
-----------
The program "fakemake" is a restricted version of make(1). 
Like make, fakemake helps you automate compiling, but unlike make, fakemake
limits itself to making one executable and assumes that you are using gcc 
to do your compilation.
 
ex/ contains some files to test the program with.

src/ contains the source code.

------
Usage:
------
 
      ./fakemake [ description-file ]
      
 
 If no description file is specified, then fmakefile is assumed to be
 the description file.

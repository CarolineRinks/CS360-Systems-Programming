# Lab 2 (Buffering)

Author: Caroline Rinks

Description
-----------
**l2p1** reads host information from the file "converted" using buffered std I/O routines
and stores the info in a red-black tree keyed on machine names. After reading in the 
file, the user is prompted to enter a machine name. The IP address and all names
associated with that machine are printed.

**l2p2** does the same thing as l2p1, but it reads the file using system calls only.

**l2p3** does the same thing as l2p2, but it uses buffering with the system calls to read the file.
